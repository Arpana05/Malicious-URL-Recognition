Utilizing Machine Learning for Malicious URL Recognition System
The Malicious URL Recognition System demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models aimed at effectively identifying potentially harmful URLs. Its primary objective is to create a robust classification model that accurately distinguishes malicious and benign URLs. 

Features
-Extraction of features from URLs for classification.
-Machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) for predicting malicious URLs.
-Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and cross-validation.
-Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
-Confusion matrix for visualizing the results.
