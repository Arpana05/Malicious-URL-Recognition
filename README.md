# Malicious URL Recognition System

The Malicious URL Recognition System demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models aimed at effectively identifying potentially harmful URLs. Its primary objective is to create a robust classification model that accurately distinguishes malicious and benign URLs.


## Features

- Extraction of features from URLs for classification.
- Machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) for predicting malicious URLs.
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and cross-validation.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Confusion matrix for visualizing the results.
